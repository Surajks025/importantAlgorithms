This repo contains important algorithms at one place.

algo1 = fast exponentiation - calculation of exponents with O(log n).

algo2 = generating subsets using bits {
  TIme complexity = O(n*2^n) where n = no. of elements in the set
  In java you must use StringBuilder or StringBuffer to obtain optimum TIme and Space complexity.
  If you use normal String class then the time complexity will shoot up to O(n^2 * 2^n) and will also consume extra memory in String pool.
}

algo3 = gcd and lcm using Euclidean Algorithm with O(log(min(a,b))).
